# Super Cashier

A Self-service checkout system in supermarkets.

## Introduction

Welcome to an exciting Python project centered around Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Our goal is to develop a sophisticated program that effortlessly handles various transaction operations such as creation, reading, updating, and removal. Additionally, it can provide us with the total price of a particular transaction, making it incredibly versatile. This project has a strong emphasis on maintaining code quality through the implementation of unit tests and following clean coding principles. Prepare to embark on a journey that combines elegance, efficiency, and the power of OOP!
